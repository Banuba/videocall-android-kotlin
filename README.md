Quick start examples for [Banuba SDK on Android](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/android/android_overview) and [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io/en/) SDK integration to enhance video calls with real-time face filters and virtual backgrounds.  
  
# Getting Started

1. Get the latest Banuba SDK client token. Please fill in our form on [form on banuba.com](https://www.banuba.com/face-filters-sdk) website, or contact us via [info@banuba.com](mailto:info@banuba.com).
2. Copy and Paste your banuba client token into appropriate section of `videocall-android-kotlin/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/sdk/example/videocall/BanubaClientToken.kt` with “” symbols. For example: banuba_token = “place_your_token_here”
3. Visit agora.io to sign up and get token, app and channel ID
4. Copy and Paste your agora token, app and chanel ID into appropriate section of `videocall-android-kotlin/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/sdk/example/videocall/AgoraClientToken.kt` with “” symbols. For example: agora_token = “place_your_token_here”
5. Open the project in Android Studio and run the necessary target using the usual steps.

# How an example works

This project is based on the PlayerAPI. CameraDevice creates and manages the Banuba camera. Agora also has its own camera module, but in this example the Agora camera is not used, so in order to disable Agora camera is called setExternalVideoSource(...).  The frames from the Banuba camera are processed within Banuba Player and the result transferred to the handler FrameOutput. In the handler, frames are passed to the Agora module via pushCustomFrame(...).
